Let  the rover explore the planet ªs surface. The task 
is to reach a certain posi7on described by a targetX
and targetY rela7ve to your star7ng posi7on (e.g. to 
take a sediment sample). 
You already reached the goal (red posi7on) when 
your rover is close enough to the goal.  
Once you connect to the Rover Simulator with your 
client (with map, username and contestId) you 
receive the rovers constraints (wheelBase and 
maxSteeringAngle) as well as the goal posi7on 
(targetX and targetY) and the targetRadius (like in 
level 4)
